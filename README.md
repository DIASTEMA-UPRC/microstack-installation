- Single-node OpenStack (MicroStack)
   - A version made to give the ability of installing an OpenStack cloud in a single-node environment.
- Multi-node OpenStack (MicroStack)
   - The same version with the Single-node OpenStack but in a version that is able to be installed in a Multi-node Environment. 
- Large-scale OpenStack (OpenStack Charms)
   - This version is used in Data Centers that a product is deployed on, 

In this repository, a documentation is given regarding the way in which MicroStack has been installed in the environment of the platform DIASTEMA [[3]](https://github.com/DIASTEMA-UPRC/openstack-heat-installation/blob/main/openstack-heat/heat-apis/use-heat-apis.md#references).
